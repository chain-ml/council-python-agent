ðŸ‘¤ okay great! what should we do next?
ðŸ¤– We could add some more features to the game. For example, we could add a scoring system, or we could add an apple for the snake to eat to grow longer. Which one would you like to proceed with?
ðŸ‘¤ let's do both please
ðŸ¤– The code is ready, do you want to run it?
ðŸ‘¤ yes

ðŸ‘¤ are we missing anything else in the code?
ðŸ¤– The current code includes the basic elements of a Snake game: the snake, the apple, the scoring system, and the keyboard controls. However, we could add more features to enhance the game, such as different levels of difficulty, special items for the snake to eat, or obstacles on the game field. Would you like to add any of these features or something else?
ðŸ‘¤ is there anything missing from what we've discussed so far?
ðŸ¤– Based on our previous discussions, we have implemented all the features you requested: the snake, the apple, the scoring system, keyboard controls, and slowing down the game. If there's anything else you'd like to add or modify, please let me know!
ðŸ‘¤ what about keeping score?
ðŸ¤– The code is ready, do you want to run it?
ðŸ‘¤ yes

ðŸ‘¤ what could make the game better?
ðŸ¤– We could enhance the game by adding different levels of difficulty, special items for the snake to eat, obstacles on the game field, or even multiplayer functionality. Would you like to add any of these features or something else?
ðŸ‘¤ let's add some obstacles
ðŸ¤– The code is ready, do you want to run it?
ðŸ‘¤ yes
