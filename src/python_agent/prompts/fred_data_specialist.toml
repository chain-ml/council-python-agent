# FREDAPI DETAILS

## Correct Usage Examples

Below are some concise examples to illustrate the correct usage of the `fredapi` library.

### 1. Search for Data Series

You can use the `search` function to find series related to your search keywords. The search function takes a single string as input. Consider iterating over a list of keywords or search terms to perform multiple searches, when needed.

#### Docstring

```docstring
Signature: fred.search(text, limit=1000, order_by=None, sort_order=None, filter=None)
Docstring:
Do a fulltext search for series in the Fred dataset. Returns information about matching series in a DataFrame.

Parameters
----------
text : str
    text to do fulltext search on, e.g., 'Real GDP'
limit : int, optional
    limit the number of results to this value. If limit is 0, it means fetching all results without limit.
order_by : str, optional
    order the results by a criterion. Valid options are 'search_rank', 'series_id', 'title', 'units', 'frequency',
    'seasonal_adjustment', 'realtime_start', 'realtime_end', 'last_updated', 'observation_start', 'observation_end',
    'popularity'
sort_order : str, optional
    sort the results by ascending or descending order. Valid options are 'asc' or 'desc'
filter : tuple, optional
    filters the results. Expects a tuple like (filter_variable, filter_value).
    Valid filter_variable values are 'frequency', 'units', and 'seasonal_adjustment'

Returns
-------
info : DataFrame
    a DataFrame containing information about the matching Fred series
```

#### Usage Example

```python
search_results = fred.search('potential gdp')
```

The resulting DataFrame will have columns: ['id', 'realtime_start', 'realtime_end', 'title', 'observation_start', 'observation_end', 'frequency', 'frequency_short', 'units', 'units_short', 'seasonal_adjustment', 'seasonal_adjustment_short', 'last_updated', 'popularity', 'notes']

And here is a JSON-formatted example of the first row of search results:

```python
search_results.head(1).to_json(orient='records')
```

```output
'[{"id":"GDPPOT","realtime_start":1692316800000,"realtime_end":1692316800000,"title":"Real Potential Gross Domestic Product","observation_start":-631152000000,"observation_end":1759276800000,"frequency":"Quarterly","frequency_short":"Q","units":"Billions of Chained 2012 Dollars","units_short":"Bil. of Chn. 2012 ","seasonal_adjustment":"Not Seasonally Adjusted","seasonal_adjustment_short":"NSA","last_updated":1690905661000,"popularity":"68","notes":"Real potential GDP is the CBO\\u2019s estimate of the output the economy would produce with a high rate of use of its capital and labor resources. The data is adjusted to remove the effects of inflation."}]'
```

### 2. Download a series

You can use the `get_series` function to download a time series corresponding to a series id. Here are the function details and docstring:

#### Docstring

```docstring
Signature:
fred.get_series(
    series_id,
    observation_start=None,
    observation_end=None,
    **kwargs,
)
Docstring:
Get data for a Fred series id. This fetches the latest known data, and is equivalent to get_series_latest_release()

Parameters
----------
series_id : str
    Fred series id such as 'CPIAUCSL'
observation_start : datetime or datetime-like str such as '7/1/2014', optional
    earliest observation date
observation_end : datetime or datetime-like str such as '7/1/2014', optional
    latest observation date
kwargs : additional parameters
    Any additional parameters supported by FRED. You can see https://api.stlouisfed.org/docs/fred/series_observations.html for the full list

Returns
-------
data : Series
    a Series where each index is the observation date and the value is the data for the Fred series

```

#### Usage Example

```python
s = fred.get_series('CPIAUCSL')
print(s)
```

```output
1947-01-01     21.480
1947-02-01     21.620
1947-03-01     22.000
1947-04-01     22.000
1947-05-01     21.950
               ...   
2023-03-01    301.808
2023-04-01    302.918
2023-05-01    303.294
2023-06-01    303.841
2023-07-01    304.348
Length: 919, dtype: float64
```

### Note
These examples cover the basic usage of the `fredapi` library, providing a convenient way to access the Federal Reserve Economic Data. The library returns data in a `pandas` `Series` or `DataFrame`, making it suitable for further analysis and visualization.

# REQUIRED CODE HEADER
Always begin your SOLUTION with the following code snippet (it contains important imports and API configuration):
$code_header

# INSTRUCTIONS
- Review the FREDAPI DETAILS for correct usage examples.
- Write or edit Python code to search for or retrieve data from FRED using fredapi.
- DO NOT erase any of the EXISTING CODE unless it is no longer needed.
- Place all code in a single code block, formatted as ```python {code} ```
- Follow PEP 8 style guides, including a max line length of 79 characters.
- Never use the input function to request input from the user. Instead, print your message to the standard output.
- Only load data into Pandas DataFrames in-memory, i.e. do not save any files to the filesystem.
- Make sure to use clear variable names and comments to indicate where data has been loaded.
- When you are asked to download data, always download it into a single Pandas DataFrame
- Avoid using print statements with Pandas objects unless you need to return specific data to the user.
- Never `append` to DataFrames. Use Python lists to collect multiple DataFrames instead.

# HINTS
- If a search has no results, it will return None. Be sure to deal with the possibility that searches may return None.

# EXISTING CODE
Use the following code as the basis of your SOLUTION. Ensure that all of this code is part of your SOLUTION unless the user is specifcally asking for parts to be removed.
$existing_code

# TASK
$task

# SOLUTION (formatted precisely as  ```python {REQUIRED CODE HEADER} {your generated code} ```)
